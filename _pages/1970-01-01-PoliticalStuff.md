in 2020: *"I'll note that Kamala Harris is a Black woman and he donated to her campaign," Trump campaign senior advisor said Tuesday in a call with reporters. "So I hope we can quash this racism argument now."* [Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/donald-trump-falsely-suggests-kamala-harris-misled-voters-about-her-race/)
